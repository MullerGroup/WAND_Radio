Side A and Side B both start at F0
Side A is idle, Side B is listening

Side A transmits Fnew on F0
Side B listens for Fnew and acknowledges on F0
repeat until CRCs match on both ends. 

Both change to Fnew. 

Side A then starts transmits 1000 packets without listening for Ack
Side B should receive continuously, just checking CRC
	Timeout once it doesn't receive anything in a while

Side B then sends a packet with RSSI/Drops info
Side A should be listening for this immediately after transmitting the 1000 packets

If Side A gets the data, it outputs it through UART
otherwise, it will ask for it again and repeat until CRC matches

Then, repeat from top

Transmit Fnew on F0 and keep doing it until something is received
Change Frequency
Transmits 1000 packets
Listens until good CRC
